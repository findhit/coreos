the missing coreos cli for creating and managing clusters


##### This repo isn't working yet!!!!
But I'm an Usain Bolt programmer, so it should be running up on a couple of days.

## Motivation

findhit entered Microsoft BizSpark program recently and we ended up choosing
CoreOS as our cloud cluster OS. We did a bunch of internal bash scripts for
handling cluster scaling and its resources but it ended up too hard to maintain.

As CTO, I've decided to create a cli manager as our scaling endpoint.
